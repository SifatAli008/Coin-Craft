---

## 🚀 **How to Access Parent Dashboard via Google Login:**

### **Step 1: Launch the Application**
```bash
launch-coincraft.bat
```

### **Step 2: Select Parent Role**
- Look for the **"I am a:"** dropdown on the login screen
- **Select "Parent/Guardian"** from the dropdown
- ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The dropdown now defaults to "Parent/Guardian" for easier testing

### **Step 3: Use Google Sign-In**
- Click the **"🔐 SIGN IN WITH GOOGLE"** button
- Wait 2 seconds for the simulated OAuth process
- You should see: **"Google sign-in successful! Welcome parent!"**

### **Step 4: Access Parent Dashboard**
- The application will automatically route you to the **Parent Dashboard**
- You'll see the comprehensive family monitoring interface

## 🐛 **Debug Information Added:**

The application now shows debug output in the console:

```
DEBUG: Role selector initialized with default value: Parent/Guardian
DEBUG: Selected role from dropdown: Parent/Guardian
DEBUG: Mapped to UserRole: PARENT
DEBUG: Created PARENT user: Sarah Johnson with role: PARENT
DEBUG: Final user before callback: Sarah Johnson with role: PARENT
DEBUG: CoinCraftApplication routing user: Sarah Johnson with role: PARENT
DEBUG: DashboardRouter routing user: Sarah Johnson with role: PARENT
DEBUG: Creating ParentDashboard for PARENT user
```

## 🎯 **What You Should See:**

### **Login Screen:**
- Role dropdown with "Parent/Guardian" selected by default
- Google sign-in button with updated styling
- Clear status messages

### **After Google Login:**
- **Window Title**: "CoinCraft - Money Explorer Adventure - Sarah Johnson (PARENT)"
- **Console Output**: "Loaded PARENT dashboard for user: Sarah Johnson"
- **Dashboard**: Full Parent Dashboard with family monitoring features

---

## 🧪 **Alternative Testing Methods:**

### **Method 1: Direct Parent Test**
```bash
test-parent-login.bat
```
This bypasses login and goes directly to the Parent Dashboard.

### **Method 2: Email/Password with Role**
- Select "Parent/Guardian" from dropdown
- Enter any email and password
- Click "🚀 START ADVENTURE"
- User role will be set to PARENT

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If Still Getting Child Dashboard:**
1. **Check the dropdown**: Make sure "Parent/Guardian" is selected
2. **Check console output**: Look for the DEBUG messages
3. **Try the test script**: Use `test-parent-login.bat` to verify Parent Dashboard works

### **Expected Console Messages:**
```
DEBUG: Role selector initialized with default value: Parent/Guardian
DEBUG: Creating ParentDashboard for PARENT user
INFO: Loaded PARENT dashboard for user: Sarah Johnson
```

### **If You See Child Dashboard Messages:**
```
DEBUG: Creating ChildDashboard for CHILD
INFO: Loaded CHILD dashboard for user: Emma Wilson
```
This means the role wasn't properly selected. Make sure to select "Parent/Guardian" before clicking Google sign-in.
