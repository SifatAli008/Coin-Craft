# Coin-Craft
CoinCraft makes learning money fun for kids through a gamified experience. It uses interactive lessons, real-world tasks, and game elements like points, badges, quests, leaderboards, and avatars. Kids learn budgeting, saving, banking, investing, and social responsibility in an engaging, practical way.
